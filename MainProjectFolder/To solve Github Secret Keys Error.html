Yes, your proposed method can solve the issue. By creating a new branch and resetting the main branch, you effectively remove the problematic commit history from main. Here's how you can do it step by step:

Step 1: Create a New Branch with the Current Content
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b new-clean-branch
This creates a new branch (new-clean-branch) with the current content, preserving the changes.

Step 2: Switch Back to the main Branch
bash
Copy code
git checkout main
Step 3: Delete All Commits from the main Branch
To remove all history from the main branch:

bash
Copy code
git reset --hard $(git commit-tree HEAD^{tree} -m "Start fresh")
This resets the main branch to a single fresh commit.

Step 4: Push the Cleaned main Branch
Force-push the main branch to overwrite the history on GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main --force
Step 5: Merge Content from new-clean-branch to main
Switch back to your new-clean-branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout new-clean-branch
Merge new-clean-branch into main:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge new-clean-branch
Step 6: Push the Updated main Branch
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Benefits of This Approach
Removes sensitive data from main history.
Preserves your current project structure and code.
Avoids triggering GitHub push protection since sensitive data no longer exists in main.

The error indicates that your local main branch and the remote main branch have diverged, likely due to a forced push (git push --force) from your previous changes. Git is asking you to decide how to handle the differences between these branches.





Recommended Action for Your Case:
Since you did a forced update earlier, it's best to reset your local branch to match the remote:

bash
Copy code
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
Then try pulling again.

Let me know if you face any further issues!
